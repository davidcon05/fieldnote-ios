# EcoJournal

iOS field journal app for environmental science fieldwork. Built as an AI-assisted learning project.

## 🔋 Offline-First Design

Eco Journal is designed to work **100% offline in remote field locations**. GPS uses satellites (not internet), and all data is stored locally.

### What Works Offline

✅ **GPS Tracking** (satellite-based, no internet needed)
✅ **Photos & Videos** (device camera, local storage)
✅ **Audio Recording + Transcription** (on-device speech-to-text)
✅ **Notes & Data Entry** (all local)
✅ **Map View** (cached tiles)
✅ **All Data Storage** (SwiftData/SQLite)

⚠️ **Optional Internet Features** (graceful degradation):
- Weather data → Shows retry button if offline
- Air quality data → Shows retry button if offline

**See:** [Offline-First Architecture](docs/architecture/offline-first-design.md) for full details

## Quick Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Purpose** | GPS-tagged field observations with photos, notes, and auto-weather logging |
| **User** | Environmental scientist working outdoors (often in remote locations) |
| **Platform** | iOS 17+ (iPhone only) |
| **Tech Stack** | SwiftUI, SwiftData, CoreLocation, OpenWeatherMap API, Speech framework |
| **Network** | Offline-first (internet enhances but is never required) |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd EcoJournal

# Open in Xcode
open EcoJournal.xcodeproj

# Build and run
⌘R
```

### Weather API Setup (Later)
1. Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Create `EcoJournal/Resources/Config.xcconfig`
3. Add: `WEATHER_API_KEY = your_key_here`
4. **Never commit** (already in .gitignore)

## Tech Stack

- **UI:** SwiftUI
- **Data:** SwiftData (offline-first)
- **Location:** CoreLocation
- **Weather:** OpenWeatherMap API
- **Maps:** MapKit

## Key Conventions

- **Journal** = Top-level container (e.g., "Soil Samples 2026")
- **Log/Entry** = Individual field observation
- **Tabs:** Logs, New Log, Map
- **Always create files in Xcode** (not Finder)

## Roadmap

| Version | Focus | Timeline |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **v1.0** | GPS, weather, photos, notes, offline | 4-6 weeks |
| **v1.5** | Land navigation (navigate to logged locations) | 2 weeks |
| **v2.0** | Enhanced camera, photo overlays | 3-4 weeks |
| **v3.0** | ARKit measurements, CoreML species ID | 4-6 weeks |
